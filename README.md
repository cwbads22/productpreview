<p><strong>My process</strong></p>

<p> Just downloaded the project directions and started coding. Did a lot of research everytime I got stuck...</p>
<p><strong>Built with </strong></p>
<p>Visual Studio Code for coding and Responsively Web Browser to view the variety of medias and responsiveness adjustments.<br>
Firefox Browser Developer Tools</p>
<br>
HTML5 markup | CSS custom properties | Flexbox | Mobile-first workflow | Responsive Dsign
<br>

<h3>What I learned</h3>
<p>This was by far the most challenging projec till now. It was very consuming and overwhelming because all the new things I had to add to my coding, like semantic HTML 5 tags, media queries in CSS. That required some hours of extra research, but finally it's done. </p>

<p>Not the bst result, but that was starting to piss me off kkkkk never thought this project could be so hard!</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Useful resources</strong></p>
<p> Lots research in this one, a very challenging piece of work. Tired now!</p>
